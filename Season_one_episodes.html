                  his grandmother where he lets it slip that Tony is seeing a psychiatrist.</p> 
                  
              <p>The situation causes Tony to reflect on his own times at that age. It was in 1967 that he learned something about 
                his father when he sees his Dad and his brother Uncle Junior beat someone up to collect a debt. <br>
                As a child, Tony thought his father also showed favoritism to his sister Janice by taking her to a fun fair every 
                Sunday. He decided to find out what exactly they were doing. In fact, his father was conducting business with 
                other mobsters who were also taking their daughters with them as a cover.</p>
