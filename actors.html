                                  width="100" height="100">Edith Falco, called Edie, was born on July 5, 1963 in Brooklyn, New 
                                  York, to Judith Anderson, an actress, and Frank Falco, a jazz drummer. Edie grew up on Long Island and attended SUNY 
                                  Purchase, where she was trained in acting at the prestigious Conservatory of Theatre Arts and Film.</p> 
                                  
                                  <p>She moved to Manhattan after graduation, auditioning for roles and supporting herself as best she 
                                  could.Falco began getting film roles, mostly smaller supporting parts, starting in the late 1980s. 
                                  Her first notable role was a supporting part in Bullets Over Broadway (1994).</p>

                                  <p>Ironically, it was in television where the conservatory-trained Falco's career first flowered. 
                                  She obtained her first recurring roles in 1993, on the acclaimed police dramas Homicide: Life on the 
                                  Street (1993), as the wife of a blinded police officer, and Law & Order (1990) as a Legal Aid 
                                  attorney. Next came a recurring role on the prison drama Oz (1997), as a sympathetic corrections 
                                  officer. All the while she continued to work in film, still in small supporting roles.</p>

                                  
                                  <p>Supporting herself in acting continued to be a challenge until at last Falco found success in 
                                  1999, when she was cast in the HBO series The Sopranos (1999), as Carmela, the wife of New Jersey 
                                  Mafia street boss Tony Soprano. <br>
                                  "The Sopranos" gained her a great deal of visibility and praise 
                                  for her exceptionally strong dramatic skills. In 2000 Falco became one of the few actresses in 
                                  history to sweep all of the major television awards (the Emmy, the Golden Globe and the SAG 
                                  Award) in one year for a dramatic role. She is also the first female actor ever to receive the 
                                  Television Critics Association Award for Individual Achievement in Drama.</p>

                                  width="100" height="100"> His film work began in the late 1980s. An early part that brought him recognition was in 
                                  Martin Scorsese's Goodfellas (1990), as Spider, a local kid who works for the gangsters and 
                                  has a run-in with a psychopathic mob soldier played by Joe Pesci.</p>

                                <p>He worked throughout the 1990s in the New York independent 
                                film industry, especially as a regular in Spike Lee's movies, appearing in Jungle Fever (1991), 
                                Malcolm X (1992), Clockers (1995), Girl 6 (1996) and Summer of Sam (1999), generally playing 
                                working-class Italian-Americans from the "outer boroughs." While rooted in the New York movie 
                                scene, Imperioli also worked in Hollywood in the mid-'90s, in the formulaic movies Bad Boys 
                                (1995) and Last Man Standing (1996).</p>  

                                <p>In 1999, Imperioli was cast in The Sopranos (1999) as Christopher Moltisanti, a low-ranking 
                                soldier in the Soprano crime organization whose family connections to street boss Tony Soprano 
                                move him up the ladder in the organization. Imperioli's multi-layered portrayal of such an 
                                unappealing character is a real highlight of the series and earned him an Emmy and a SAG award.</p>

                                  width="100" height="100">Steven Van Zandt, also known as Little Steven or Miami Steve, 
                                  is an American singer, songwriter, musician, producer, actor, activist and author. He is best 
                                  known as a member of Bruce Springsteen's E Street Band, in which he plays guitar and mandolin. 
                                  He is also known for his roles in several television drama series, including as Silvio Dante 
                                  in The Sopranos (1999-2007) and as Frank Tagliano in Lilyhammer (2012-2014).</p>

                                  <p>Until 1999, Van Zandt had no professional acting experience. His main focus had been music, 
                                  whether it was the multiple bands he participated in, groups he composed pieces for, or music 
                                  he wrote on his own. Then, he was asked to play a part in The Sopranos, and from there on, 
                                  acting became part of Van Zandt's career.</p>

                                <p>Van Zandt took one of the lead roles in The Sopranos, playing level-headed but deadly mob consigliere 
                                and strip club owner Silvio Dante. Van Zandt had no acting experience, and the unusual casting choice was 
                                made by series creator David Chase.<br>
                                Van Zandt had never acted before; he auditioned for the role of Tony Soprano, but HBO felt that 
                                the role should go to an experienced actor, 
                                so Chase wrote him into a part that did not exist. Van Zandt eventually agreed to star on the 
                                show as consigliere Silvio Dante, and his real-life spouse Maureen (née Santoro) was cast as his on-
                                screen wife Gabriella.</p>

                                  width="100" height="100">Tony Sirico was born in New York City on July 29, 1942 to a family of Italian descent. He grew up 
                                  in the Brooklyn neighborhoods of East Flatbush and Bensonhurst. His brother, Father Robert 
                                  Sirico, is a Catholic priest and co-founder of the Acton Institute for the Study of Religion 
                                  and Liberty.</p>

                                  <p>Sirico was convicted of several crimes and was arrested 28 times, including for disorderly 
                                  conduct, assault, and robbery, before taking up acting. <br>
                                  Sirico's first confirmed role in film was as an extra in the 1974 film Crazy Joe, securing 
                                  the role with the help of Richard Castellano.</p>

                                  <p>Sirico played gangsters in a number of films, including Goodfellas, Mob Queen, Mighty Aphrodite, 
                                  Love and Money, Fingers, The One Man Jury, Defiance, The Last Fight, Innocent Blood, Bullets 
                                  over Broadway, The Pick-up Artist, Gotti, The Search for One-eye Jimmy, Cop Land, Turn of 
                                  Faith, Hello Again, Mickey Blue Eyes, and Wonder Wheel.<br>
                                  He also played policemen in the films Dead Presidents and Deconstructing Harry. Sirico was a 
                                  close friend of Woody Allen, and appeared in seven of his films.</p>

                                  <p>Sirico's most acclaimed acting job was that of Paulie Gualtieri in David Chase's Emmy award 
                                  winning drama, The Sopranos. He originally auditioned for the role of Uncle Junior with Frank 
                                  Vincent, but Dominic Chianese landed the role. David Chase instead offered him the role of 
                                  Paulie Gualtieri; Sirico agreed under the condition that his character "would not become a rat".</p>
                                  
                                  <p>Tony Sirico died on July 8, 2022, from undisclosed causes, aged 79.</p>

          width="100" height="100">Andrea Donna de Matteo, called Drea (pronounced "dray"), was born on January 19, 1972 in Queens, New York, into an 
          affluent family, the youngest of three children and the only girl. She is the daughter of Donna, a playwright and 
          playwriting teacher at HB Studio in New York, and Albert A. De Matteo, a furniture manufacturer. <br>
          De Matteo spent her early childhood in Queens, and the family then moved to the Upper East Side in Manhattan, 
          into Aretha Franklin's former townhouse.</p>

        <p>De Matteo decided to pursue a directing career at NYU's Tisch School of the Arts. Once she was in 
          school, however, it was the acting classes which attracted her greatest interest, and she decided on an acting career. <br>
          After a screen debut in an obscure independent and a small part in a small movie, Meet Prince Charming, 
          de Matteo auditioned for a one-episode part in the HBO series The Sopranos. <br>
          She impressed the producers enough that they expanded the role, as Adriana La Cerva, girlfriend to up-and-coming 
          Soprano family soldier Christopher Moltisanti (Michael Imperioli), and she eventually became a regular on the show. 
          She won an Emmy award for her portrayal of Adriana in 2004.</p>
          
        <p>Although De Matteo's role on the HBO series ended in 2004, in that same year she got a leading role in Joey (2004), 
          a spin-off of the long-running NBC sitcom Friends (1994). She has also appeared in several movies since starting
