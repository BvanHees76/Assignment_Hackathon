                <p>While attending a family funeral Tony decides to visit his father's grave and there meets Fran Felstein, his father's mistress. 
                She has many stories to tell him - she claims to have been one of JFK's girlfriends - and Tony takes an interest in her welfare. 
                She claims that her father had promised her his share of a track he owned but that Hesh had cheated her out of her inheritance. 
                When Hesh decides to sell the track, Tony makes sure she gets her share.</p> 
                
                <p>The sale causes friction with Phil Leotardo, Johnny Sack's right hand man. 
                As for funerals, Uncle Junior has decided that going to funerals is a good way to get out his house arrest, at least for 5 hours on 
                each occasion. He's taken to scanning obituaries to see what might be available.</p> 
                
                <p>Christopher has been helping a friend he made in rehab, J.T. Dolan, a TV writer. While J.T. has successfully stayed away from drugs 
                and alcohol, he is quickly developing a new addiction - gambling. Christopher arranges for him to play in their high stakes game 
                and after losing a hefty sum, borrows money from Chris to pay it off. J.T. doesn't seem to understand that Christopher is deadly 
                serious when he says he will be paid on time - or else.</p>
